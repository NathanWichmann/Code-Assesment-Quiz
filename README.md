# Code-Assesment-Quiz
This repository (Code Assesment Quiz) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. Student were asked to design and implement 
an assesment quiz similar to the ones that are used for job interviews. Many companies will administer a codeing assesment quiz to get a better understanding 
of prospective job seekers coding abilities. The questions asked are cosing based and usually multiple choice and fill in the blanks. I choose very simple questions, I was more concerned with making sure my code is functional, rather than its contents at this point. All three aspects of web deveoplment have been brought together, html, css and javascript. This allows for a more interactive user experience and creates a more dynamic website.

# Assignment 
The assignment details are very straight forward. Design a timed coding Quiz that can save highscores so the user can gauge progress compared to their peers. However, the implementation is not. This assignment requires a great deal of javascript and being that this is only a few weeks into the course, it proved to be as dificult as the previous assignment. The obsicle with this assignment was bringing all of the learning together to make this quiz. 

# What I learnt  
I spent many hours trying to make sense of the assignment. The process took way more time than I thought it would. I would try code and find out errors in the console and try and track down what the errors meant. The console.log is a great tool for finding coding errors, however there has to be an error to use this tool. Sometimes, there was no error to be had but it was clear it wasnt working. Well, I should say I would try to consol.log working and nothing would show. So, it was back to the code. Learning code is extremely time consuming and I am embarrased to admit these assignment take me way to long to do. Functions continue to be an issue, however, after this assignment I understand how to implement them a little better. 
The terminology and syntax and placing of brackets is becoming more familiar for me. The progress is slow, but there appears to be progress nontheless. 
I seem to be own worst enemy when it comes to coding. I was having so much trouble from the very begining with making each div or section have enough room to show its content. 
It wasnt until I had a session with my tutor that he found out why. I had noticed in class that the instructor had put in a line height of 1.5. I decided to add it tom my body in the css. The only propblem was that I put 1.5px instead of 1.5mm. So everytime I added something to the screen it was smashed into the 1.5px space. I would add padding and margins and try and get the right display but it didnt always wrork but i didnt give up and kept working on making each div but didnt know why until the very end. 
This was exactly like the form/button issue. I added a form to the html and didnt know at the time i had to stop the default event.
