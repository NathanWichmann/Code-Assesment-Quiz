# Code-Assesment-Quiz
This repository (Code Assesment Quiz) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. Student were asked to design and implement 
an assesment quiz similar to the ones that are used for job interviews. Many companies will administer a codeing assesment quiz to get a better understanding 
of prospective job seekers coding abilities. The questions asked are cosing based and usually multiple choice and fill in the blanks. I choose very simple questions, I was more concerned with making sure my code is functional, rather than its contents at this point. All three aspects of web deveoplment have been brought together, html, css and javascript. This allows for a more interactive user experience and creates a more dynamic website.
