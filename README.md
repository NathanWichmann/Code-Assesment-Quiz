# Code-Assesment-Quiz
This repository (Code Assesment Quiz) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. Student were asked to design and implement 
an assesment quiz similar to the ones that are used for job interviews. Many companies will administer a codeing assesment quiz to get a better understanding 
of prospective job seekers coding abilities. The questions asked are cosing based and usually multiple choice and fill in the blanks. I choose very simple questions, I was more concerned with making sure my code is functional, rather than its contents at this point.
